# pystemd.run

> pystemd.run is inspired by systemd-run, but with a pythonic feel to it.

The key word here is _inspired_, pystemd.run can act and look like systemd-run
in many scenarios, but unlike pystemd, it's not a wrapper around the systemd-run
C calls, it's a reimplementation of the same ideas but in Python. With that
said, it is heavily inspired by the systemd-run source code, but it diverges from it
when needed to be more pythonic, or when systemd-run relies on systemd internals
that are not exposed as API.

One extra thing to notice is that pystemd.run is an API, not a command line tool,
so we will not assume that this is the only thing your program calls,
but we will assume that this just another building block for your program.

## Options:

* cmd: Array with the command to execute (absolute path only)
* name: Name of the unit, if not provided autogenerated.
* user: Username to execute the command, defaults to current user.
* user_mode: Equivalent to running `systemd-run --user`. Defaults to True
          if current user id not root (uid = 0).
* nice: Nice level to run the command.
* env: A dict with environmental variables.
* machine: Machine name to execute the command, by default we connect to
          the host's dbus.
* wait: wait for command completition before returning control, defaults
          to False.
* remain_after_exit: If True, the transient unit will remain after cmd
          has finish, also if true, this methods will return
          pystemd.systemd1.Unit object. defaults to False and this method
          returns None and the unit will be gone as soon as is done.
* stdin: Specify a file descriptor for stdin, by default this is `None`
          and your unit will not have a stdin, you can specify it as
          `sys.stdin.fileno()`, or as a regular numer, e.g. `0`.
* stdout: Specify a file descriptor for stdout, by default this is `None`
          and your unit will not have a stdout, you can specify it as
          `sys.stdout.fileno()`, or `open('/tmp/out', 'w').fileno()`, or a
          regular number, e.g. `1`.
* stderr: Specify a file descriptor for stderr, by default this is `None`
          and your unit will not have a stderr, you can specify it as
          `sys.stderr.fileno()`, or `open('/tmp/err', 'w').fileno()`, or a
          regular number, e.g. `2`.

## Examples

  Usage examples (all run as root):

  1.- executes a ``/bin/sleep 42` in the background.

```python
>>> import pystemd.run
>>> pystemd.run([b'/bin/sleep', b'42'])
```

  2.- executes `/bin/sleep 42` but returns the units

```python
>>> import pystemd.run
>>> unit = pystemd.run([b'/bin/sleep', b'42'], remain_after_exit=True)
>>> unit
<pystemd.systemd1.unit.Unit at 0x7f8c460695c0>
>>> unit.Service.MainPID
66244
>>> # ... waiting 42 seconds later
>>> unit.Service.MainPID
0
```

  3.- executing `/bin/sleep 42` as other user

```python
>>> import pystemd.run
>>> unit = pystemd.run([b'/bin/sleep', b'42'], remain_after_exit=True,
    user=b'aleivag'
)
```

  4.- Multiple things: Executing `/bin/env`, on a machine named `miniarch`,
   watching the output of the command.

```python
>>> import pystemd.run, sys
>>> pystemd.run(
    [b'/bin/env'],
    machine=b'miniarch',
    wait=True,
    nice=3,
    stdout=sys.stdout.fileno(),
    env={b'SUPER_SECRET_PASSW': b'1234'}
    )
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
INVOCATION_ID=d7abcffb71ba419cbac448baa00cb495
SUPER_SECRET_PASSW=1234
```

## Extra notes:

1.- Please note that to use `pystemd.run`, you need to `import pystemd.run`,
importing pystemd and then calling `pystemd.run` will not work.

2.- Right now `pystemd.run` (the same as `pystemd`), does not accept string as
arguments but they have to be bytes, e.g. commands are not `['/bin/true']` they
are `[b'/bin/true']`

3.- stuff systemd-run does that pystemd.run does not (yet) does, but its on the
road-map:
    a) Run on a remote host.
    b) Open a tty, you can pass std{in,out,err} file descriptors, but not a tty (yet)
    c) Run something different than a transient service, e.g. a timer.
